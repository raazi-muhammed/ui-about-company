                            Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the
                            global world population with some countries and
                            entities actively fighting against its mass adoption
                            and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
                            fort.

                        Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to
                        thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one
                        problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the
                        moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to the
                        cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down?
                        So down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple
                        words to their followers and have them download an app,
                        buy into the social currency of their favourite person
                        and watch their investment as is with other crypto
                        currency project.

                        We are trying to do to this space what investment apps
                        did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are
                        gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces
                        instead of hard to understand projects to make it the
                        norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a
                        lot of people to finally give this space a real look.

                            A new digital economy is coming. People would be
                            just as powerful as countries and creators would be
                            paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social
                            media platforms can offer.

                        There would be new markets and advertisers with little
                        to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye said,
